# BoggleBot

This program will find all possible words on a Boggle board following the rules of the classic word game:
 - Letters must be adjacent (diagonals included)
 - Cannot use the same letter block in the same word
 - Words must be at least 3 letters long

The dictionary file used is the official Hasbro Scrabble dictionary, which is typically the accepted dictionary for a real game of Boggle.

Either use the convert_to_board method and enter a 16 letter string, or manually change the array at the bottom of bogglebot.rb for a board of any size.
